# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
**Simplification and refactoring of agent execution logic**. The initial attempt to create a full "dry run" system that executes all steps sequentially has proven problematic - the agent gets confused and fails on test tasks. The priority is now to simplify the core execution flow back to a more manageable, step-by-step approach.

## Recent Work
- **Full Implementation Attempt**: Created a complex execution loop that processes all TaskStep objects sequentially, executing all associated GBOX actions for each step
- **Debugging Infrastructure**: Added extensive debug printing to track the flow of thought, steps, and action results
- **Action Configuration**: Implemented `_create_gbox_action()` helper method using `functools.partial` to pre-configure GBOX actions with system prompts and background context
- **Complete Execution Flow**: Agent now loops through all steps and actions, capturing detailed results from each `box.action.ai()` call including output, messages, actions, reasoning, and model info
- **Snapshot Creation**: Created `gbox_agent2.py` as a backup of the complex implementation before simplification

## Implementation Status
- **Completed**: Full TaskStep management system with comprehensive execution loop and detailed result capture
- **Problem Identified**: The complex approach causes the agent to get confused during actual test runs - it starts the device but then fails to execute tasks properly
- **Immediate Need**: Simplification of the execution logic to a more focused, step-by-step approach
- **Blocked**: Current implementation is too complex for practical use

## Key Learnings
- **Complexity Problem**: Implementing a full "dry run" of all steps at once creates confusion rather than clarity
- **Debug Infrastructure Valuable**: The extensive logging provides good visibility into what the agent is thinking and doing
- **TaskStep Foundation Solid**: The basic TaskStep class structure is good, but the execution pattern needs simplification
- **Gbox Box Architecture**: The `box` created by `self.gbox.create()` is a temporary remote control for the persistent local Android emulator. Terminating the box (via `box.terminate()`) only shuts down the remote control - all changes made to the emulator persist and are available for AndroidWorld's validation logic. This confirms that creating/terminating boxes per task is the correct approach.

## Next Actions
1. **Simplify Execution Loop**: Refactor the agent to execute one step at a time, wait for results, and validate before proceeding
2. **Remove Complex Flow**: Strip out the nested loops that process all steps/actions in sequence
3. **Add Proper Return**: Implement a proper `AgentInteractionResult` return instead of `sys.exit(1)`
4. **Focus on Single Task**: Get one simple task (like ContactsAddContact) working before expanding complexity
5. **Preserve Good Parts**: Keep the TaskStep structure, action configuration helper, and debug infrastructure

## Decision Context
The user noted that the current method "doesn't work for the test task it just starts the device then starts getting confused." This confirms that the full execution approach was overengineered and needs to be simplified to a more focused, incremental execution model.
