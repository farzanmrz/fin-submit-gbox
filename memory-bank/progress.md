# Project Progress

## Completed Components
- **Environment Setup**: AVD configuration, GBOX CLI integration, Python dependencies
- **Agent Foundation**: Basic GboxAgent class with environment interface
- **State Access**: Methods to retrieve UI elements, pixels, and forest representation
- **LLM Orchestrator**: Gemini API integration with semantic prompting
- **Debug Infrastructure**: Logging, reproducible testing, error handling
- **Documentation Structure**: Memory bank system for context management
- **TaskStep Class**: Structured representation of individual task steps with status tracking
- **Task Management Foundation**: GboxAgent now converts orchestrator steps into TaskStep objects stored in self.init_steps

## Active Development
- **Core Agent Simplification**: Refactor overly complex execution loop that causes confusion
  - Status: Complex implementation complete but non-functional, needs simplification
  - Priority: HIGH - Current approach causes agent to get confused during test runs
- **Single Step Execution**: Implement focused, one-step-at-a-time execution pattern
  - Status: Target pattern documented in systemPatterns.md, implementation pending
  - Dependency: Requires removal of complex nested loops in current agent

## Remaining Work
- **Core Functionality**:
  - Complete feedback loop implementation
  - Add step validation and error recovery
  - Implement retry logic for failed actions
  
- **Enhancement Features**:
  - Multi-LLM provider support (OpenAI, Ollama)
  - Dynamic model selection based on task complexity
  - Performance metrics and logging
  
- **Testing & Optimization**:
  - Full benchmark suite validation
  - Prompt engineering refinement
  - Response time optimization

## Task Completion Validation Process
**Critical Understanding**: AndroidWorld uses external validation, not agent-provided data.

### Validation Flow
1. **Agent Execution**: Agent performs actions via GBOX SDK on local Android emulator
2. **Agent Return**: Agent returns `AgentInteractionResult(done=False, data=data)` 
   - The `data` field content is completely ignored by the benchmark
3. **External Validation**: Benchmark framework calls `task.is_successful(env)` method
4. **Task-Specific Checking**: Each task has custom validation logic
   - `ContactsAddContact`: Uses `contacts_utils.list_contacts()` to verify contact exists with exact name/phone
   - Other tasks: Check app state, file system, database entries, etc.
5. **Success Determination**: Returns 1.0 for success, 0.0 for failure

### Key Implications
- **Focus on Actions**: Agent must actually perform the required changes on the device
- **State Persistence**: Changes persist on emulator even after GBOX box termination
- **Data Irrelevant**: What agent returns in `data` field has no impact on task success
- **Validation is External**: Success/failure determined by checking actual device state

## Known Limitations
- Single LLM provider (Gemini only)
- No step validation between plan and execution
- Limited error recovery mechanisms
- Manual AVD and GBOX setup required
