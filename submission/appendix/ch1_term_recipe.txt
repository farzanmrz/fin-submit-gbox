I0000 00:00:1756205848.635275 5145209 fork_posix.cc:71] Other threads are currently calling into gRPC, skipping fork() handlers
Goal: Create a new contact for Abdullah Wang. Their number is +14268077325.
----------step 1

Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Contacts"}
Reason: To create a new contact for Abdullah Wang with the specified phone number, I need to access the Contacts app. Since the Contacts app is not directly visible on the current screen, I will use the "open_app" action to open it directly.

Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: To proceed with creating a new contact for Abdullah Wang, we need to bypass the initial sign-in or backup prompts in the Contacts app. The screen currently displays options to either sign in or skip. Since the goal is to create a contact without necessarily signing in, the best action is to click on the "Skip" button to move forward to the main interface of the Contacts app where we can add a new contact.
